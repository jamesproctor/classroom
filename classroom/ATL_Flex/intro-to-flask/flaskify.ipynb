    "Using flask is pretty simple, but the orchestration of details and the command-line methods for installing, setting up and constructing your files and folders can make it seem difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are frequently many ways to accomplish a task, and if there are, there is no one 'right' way so you should focus on what you need to accomplish and use the method easist for you to wrap your head around to make it happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to getting your flask website up and running, is to be sure that you build it ONE FUNCTION AT A TIME and move slowly because it is easier to debug one thing at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flask Websites are Websites\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of this is the fact that flask is a wrapper around a system of HTML templates and Javascript implementations. With that in mind, the most important thing to focus on is that you are building a website.\n",
    "\n",

    "Notice that each file type you intend to serve has a host directory within the 'root' directory of your master folder. This makes referencing, managing and most importantly perhaps securing your images much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this convention with Flask as well, however we will add some other components to the directory, as our pages become more complex, to host Flask specific files. For now we will start with a simple directory structure in Flask that looks like this:\n",
